# JamMate ⚡️ (Working title, too corny atm)

## Problem

Finding bandmates can be difficult out in the real world. From people you don't know to all-around flakey people. JamMate will serve as a way to network and connect musicians, producers, and stagehands together to serve a common goal: to collab and jam!

---

## Proposal

JamMate will be a matchmaking application that suggests artists to users to work with. Users will create a profile with their own wanted ad for their project, whether they want to start a band or contribute to one, or if they are just looking for buddies to play music with.

---

## MVC

- User-based authentication/sign-up
- Profile creation
- Get matched with musicians in their area based on suggestions
- Direct messaging

*... and feel free to link to other more detailed documents*

---


## Design

- Bottom Nav bar (matches, profile, search?)
- Matches display musicians closest to criteria
- Profile CRUD (name, instruments played, equipment option, wanted, inspiration, demo upload)
- Search (search by skill, instruments, skillsets)

---

## Framework/ Technologies 

### Frontend

- React Native

### Backend

- Firebase
---

### Additional Tools

- [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) for real-time messaging
---

## Stretch Goals

- Allow users to upload and share their music
- Integrate with social media platforms to expand the user base (Instagram, SoundCloud, Bandcamp)
- Implement a feature to search for musicians based on their skills and experience
- Access to the camera to take a picture in the app
- Allow users to create and join groups based on shared interests or genres

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Nothing to add at the moment
